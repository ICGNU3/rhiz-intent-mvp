# Rhiz - Intent-First Relationship Intelligence

Rhiz is an AI-powered platform that captures high-signal relationship data from calendar attendees and voice notes, then generates smart introduction suggestions based on your goals.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp docs/env.example .env

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Seed with demo data
pnpm db:seed

# Start development
pnpm dev              # Web app
pnpm workers:start    # Workers
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the demo with seeded data.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run Locally with Seed Data

The application comes with comprehensive demo data that demonstrates all features:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
- Redis instance
- OpenAI API key

### Setup Steps

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your credentials:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/rhiz
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-encryption-key
   ```

3. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate   # Creates all tables with RLS policies
   pnpm db:seed      # Loads demo data
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev          # Web app on http://localhost:3000
   pnpm workers:start # Background workers
   ```

### Demo Data Included

The seed script creates:
- **1 demo user** (demo-user-id)
- **3 organizations** (TechCorp, StartupHub, Innovation Labs)
- **5 people** with full profiles and claims
- **3 encounters** (meetings and calls)
- **1 active goal** (Raise $2M Seed Round)
- **13 claims** (facts about people)
- **3 edges** (relationships between people)
- **3 suggestions** with AI-generated intro drafts
- **2 tasks** (follow-up reminders)
- **4 event logs** (audit trail)

### What You'll See

1. **Home page** shows Intent Cards with:
   - Goal title: "Raise $2M Seed Round"
   - Top 2 suggestions with scores and mutual interests
   - 1 insight with confidence score

2. **People page** displays contacts with:
   - Relationship strength indicators
   - Last encounter dates
   - Known information (title, company, expertise)

3. **Suggestions page** shows:
   - Introduction drafts
   - "Why this match" explanations
   - Accept/reject actions

4. **Goals page** lists:
   - Active goals with status
   - Suggestion counts
   - Creation dates

### Testing the Features

- **Voice recording**: Record a voice note to see transcription and entity extraction
- **Calendar upload**: Upload the example ICS file from `docs/example.ics`
- **Agent workflows**: Watch the worker logs to see background processing
- **Security**: Check that RLS policies are working (data isolation by owner_id)

### Troubleshooting

- **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **Redis connection**: Verify Redis is running on the configured port
- **OpenAI API**: Check your API key has sufficient credits
- **Workers not starting**: Check Redis connection and role environment variables
