# Relationship Command Center - Implementation Prompt

## Overview
Create a sophisticated relationship intelligence dashboard that combines an interactive network graph visualization with a conversational AI interface. The graph takes up 60% of the screen, with a chat interface below that controls and augments the visualization in real-time.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Network Graph Visualization (60% of screen)
Create an interactive force-directed graph using React Flow or D3.js that displays:

**Visual Elements:**
- **Nodes**: Represent people with sizes based on relationship strength (1-10 scale)
- **Node Colors**: 
  - Green: High goal alignment (80%+ match)
  - Yellow: Moderate alignment (50-79% match)
  - Blue: Your direct connections
  - Gray: Inactive/dormant relationships (>90 days no contact)
  - Purple: Key connectors (high betweenness centrality)
- **Edges**: Connection lines showing:
  - Solid lines: Existing connections
  - Dashed lines: Suggested connections
  - Line thickness: Relationship strength
  - Animated particles: Recent interactions
- **Clusters**: Auto-group nodes by:
  - Industry/sector
  - Geographic location
  - Alma mater
  - Shared interests
  - Company/organization

**Interactive Features:**
- Click node to show person details in side panel
- Hover to see connection strength and last interaction
- Drag nodes to reorganize
- Zoom and pan controls
- Filter buttons for different relationship types
- Heat map overlay showing "connection opportunity scores"
- Search bar to find specific people
- Time slider to see relationship evolution

### 2. Conversational AI Interface (40% of screen)
Create a chat interface that controls the graph and provides relationship intelligence:

**Chat Capabilities:**
```typescript
interface ConversationalCommands {
  // Graph Control Commands
  "Show me [filter]": FilterGraph; // "Show me investors", "Show me people in NYC"
  "Hide [filter]": HideNodes; // "Hide inactive connections"
  "Focus on [person]": CenterNode; // "Focus on Sarah Chen"
  "Connect [person] to [person]": ShowPath; // "Connect me to Reid Hoffman"
  
  // Relationship Intelligence
  "Who should I introduce?": SuggestIntroductions;
  "Who can help with [goal]?": FindHelpers;
  "What do [person] and [person] have in common?": FindCommonGround;
  "How do I strengthen my relationship with [person]?": RelationshipAdvice;
  
  // Action Commands
  "Draft intro between [people]": GenerateIntroEmail;
  "Schedule follow-up with [person]": CreateTask;
  "Add note about [person]": SaveClaim;
  "Remind me to [action]": SetReminder;
}
```

**AI Response Features:**
- Natural language responses with specific, actionable advice
- Graph animations synchronized with AI responses
- Suggested actions with one-click execution
- Context-aware suggestions based on current graph view
- Personality insights based on communication patterns

### 3. Connection Scoring Algorithm
Implement a sophisticated scoring system based on relationship psychology:

```typescript
interface ConnectionScore {
  // Professional Factors (40% weight)
  industryAlignment: number; // Same or complementary industries
  careerStageMatch: number; // Similar seniority or mentor/mentee potential
  skillComplementarity: number; // Skills that enhance each other
  businessNeedAlignment: number; // One needs what other offers
  
  // Social Factors (30% weight)
  mutualConnections: number; // Shared contacts (triangulation principle)
  geographicProximity: number; // Physical distance
  communicationStyleMatch: number; // Formal vs casual preferences
  responseTimeCompatibility: number; // Similar communication cadence
  
  // Personal Factors (30% weight)
  sharedInterests: number; // Hobbies, causes, passions
  almaMaterConnection: number; // School connections
  lifeStageAlignment: number; // Similar life situations
  valueAlignment: number; // Shared principles/causes
}
```

### 4. Relationship Intelligence Features

**From "Never Eat Alone" Principles:**
- **Generosity Tracker**: Track giving vs receiving ratio per relationship
- **Follow-up Cadence**: Suggest optimal contact frequency per person
- **Mutual Aid Matching**: Find win-win introduction opportunities
- **Vulnerability Moments**: Flag when contacts share challenges (opportunity to help)

**From "How to Win Friends" Principles:**
- **Interest Mapper**: Track and surface what each person cares about
- **Achievement Highlighter**: Remember and celebrate others' wins
- **Name/Detail Reminder**: Surface important details before meetings
- **Appreciation Prompter**: Suggest when to express gratitude

**From Modern Network Science:**
- **Weak Tie Identifier**: Highlight high-potential dormant connections
- **Structural Holes**: Find gaps in network to bridge
- **Cluster Bridging**: Identify people who connect different groups
- **Network Redundancy**: Flag over-connected clusters

### 5. UI/UX Requirements

## Example Interactions

**Scenario 1: Finding Investors**
```
You: "Show me investors interested in AI"
AI: *Graph highlights 5 nodes in green* 
    "I found 5 investors in your network interested in AI. Sarah Chen 
    is most aligned - she just led a $10M round in an AI startup. 
    You're connected through Mike Ross. Should I draft an intro?"
```

**Scenario 2: Strengthening Relationships**
```
You: "Who should I reconnect with?"
AI: *Graph pulses 3 dormant connections*
    "Your relationship with David Kim has weakened. You used to talk 
    monthly about product strategy. He just became VP of Product at 
    Stripe. A congratulations message could rekindle this valuable 
    connection."
```

**Scenario 3: Strategic Introductions**
```
You: "Who would benefit from knowing each other?"
AI: *Draws animated line between two nodes*
    "Jessica (seeking CMO) and Marcus (recruiter specializing in 
    marketing executives) would be perfect. They're both Stanford GSB 
    alumni and passionate about sustainable brands. Draft intro?"
```

## Success Metrics

- User can understand their network structure in <10 seconds
- AI suggestions have >70% acceptance rate
- Average session time >15 minutes

## Key Implementation Notes

1. Start with 2D graph, add 3D as enhancement
2. Use progressive disclosure - show more detail on zoom
3. Cache graph layouts to prevent constant recalculation
4. Implement undo/redo for graph manipulations
5. Save user's preferred graph arrangements
6. Add export functionality (PNG, PDF, CSV)
7. Include onboarding tour for first-time users
8. Build mobile-responsive version with touch gestures

This is your blueprint for creating a revolutionary relationship intelligence platform that makes networking feel like a strategic game with an AI copilot.
