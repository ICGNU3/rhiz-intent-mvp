## üìä Expected Results

With n8n integration, interviews become much more powerful:

### Before n8n
- User: "I met with Sarah from TechCorp"
- Agent: "Tell me more about Sarah"

### After n8n
- User: "I met with Sarah from TechCorp"
- n8n enriches: Sarah Chen, VP Engineering, LinkedIn profile, email
- Agent: "Sarah Chen, the VP of Engineering? She has an impressive background in ML infrastructure. How did your conversation go?"

### Automated Follow-ups
- **Email found**: "I found Sarah's email (s.chen@techcorp.com). Would you like me to draft an introduction?"
- **Mutual connections**: "You both know Alex Kim from Google. That could be a great introduction path."
- **CRM sync**: "I've updated Sarah's profile in HubSpot with your conversation notes."

## üîÑ Webhook Responses

All n8n workflows send results back to `/api/webhooks/n8n` with this structure:

```json
{
  "workflowId": "person-lookup",
  "executionId": "uuid",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "person": {
      "name": "Sarah Chen",
      "email": "s.chen@techcorp.com",
      "linkedin_url": "linkedin.com/in/sarahchen",
      "title": "VP Engineering",
      "company": "TechCorp",
      "bio": "Leading ML infrastructure at TechCorp..."
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user-id",
    "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

This creates a seamless flow where interviews become increasingly intelligent as they progress, with real-time enrichment making each question more targeted and valuable.
