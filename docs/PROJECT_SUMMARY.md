- Goal-aligned suggestion generation
- "Why this match" explanations

### 5. Safe Integrations
- Provider interface with null provider default
- Feature flags for external services
- Works without external API keys
- Clear upgrade path to paid providers

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- Row-level security (RLS) on all tables
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Consent & Provenance
- Every claim includes source, lawful basis, and provenance
- Granular consent tracking with policy versions
- GDPR-compliant data subject rights
- Complete audit trail for all data processing

### Exclusions (What We Don't Do)
- No LinkedIn automation or scraping
- No Gmail server-side integration
- No private page scraping
- No unauthorized data collection

## 🔧 Agent System

### Role-Based Workers
- **IntentRouter**: Processes events, extracts/updates goals
- **CaptureAgent**: Creates encounters and claims from raw data
- **EnrichmentAgent**: Adds claims from external providers
- **MatchingAgent**: Builds candidate pairs and computes scores
- **IntroWriter**: Drafts introduction messages
- **FollowUp**: Schedules nudges and tracks outcomes

### Queue Architecture
- `events.ingested` - Main event processing
- `ingest.calendar` - Calendar data processing
- `ingest.voice` - Voice note processing
- `enrich` - Data enrichment jobs
- `match` - Matching and scoring jobs
- `intro` - Introduction drafting jobs
- `followup` - Follow-up scheduling jobs

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **person**: Contact information with encryption
- **encounter**: Meetings, calls, voice notes
- **claim**: Facts about people with confidence and provenance
- **goal**: User intents that drive the system
- **suggestion**: AI-generated introduction recommendations
- **consent**: GDPR-compliant consent tracking
- **event_log**: Comprehensive audit trail

### Key Features
- UUID primary keys for security
- Timestamps for all records
- JSONB fields for flexible metadata
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies for multi-tenancy

## 🎨 User Interface

### Components Built
- **Navigation**: Clean, responsive navigation
