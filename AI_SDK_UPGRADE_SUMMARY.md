# AI SDK Upgrade Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Agent class to better utilize the Vercel AI SDK features, replacing manual OpenAI calls with structured extraction, adding streaming capabilities, and improving error handling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Agent Class** (`apps/web/lib/agent.ts`)

#### ✅ **Structured Data Extraction**
- Replaced manual JSON parsing with Zod schemas
- Added comprehensive parsing schemas for people, goals, actions, facts
- Improved confidence scoring and metadata tracking
- Added sentiment and urgency detection

#### ✅ **Streaming Support**
- Added `streamProcess()` method for real-time responses
- Implemented chunk-by-chunk streaming with progress callbacks
- Maintained backward compatibility with non-streaming mode

#### ✅ **Better Error Handling**
- Graceful fallbacks when AI models are unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- Metadata tracking for debugging and monitoring

#### ✅ **Enhanced Action Processing**
- Added new actions: `schedule_followup`, `add_reminder`
- Improved goal detection with more specific types
- Better fact extraction with confidence scores

### 2. **Updated Chat API** (`apps/web/app/api/chat/route.ts`)

#### ✅ **Streaming API Endpoint**
- Replaced simple chat with Agent-powered responses
- Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- Enhanced response format with cards and metadata
- Better error handling and status reporting

### 3. **Improved Chat UI** (`apps/web/app/chat/page.tsx`)

#### ✅ **Real-time Streaming**
- Live text streaming as AI responds
- Progress indicators and loading states
- Error handling and recovery

#### ✅ **Enhanced Metadata Display**
- Confidence scores and processing times
- Model information and status
- Visual indicators for AI capabilities

#### ✅ **Better Card Rendering**
- Improved people, suggestions, and goal cards
- Action buttons with proper event handling
- Responsive design and accessibility

## Technical Architecture

### **Before (Manual OpenAI)**
```typescript
// Manual API calls with JSON parsing
const completion = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [...],
  temperature: 0.1,
});
const response = JSON.parse(completion.choices[0]?.message?.content);
```

### **After (AI SDK)**
```typescript
// Structured extraction with type safety
const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: models.default,
  schema: parseSchema,
  prompt: text,
  system: systemPrompt,
});
```

## New Features

### **1. Streaming Responses**
- Real-time text generation
- Progress tracking
- Better user experience

### **2. Enhanced Parsing**
- People extraction with roles and companies
- Goal detection with confidence scores
- Action identification with context
- Fact extraction with metadata

### **3. Metadata Tracking**
- Processing time measurement
- Confidence scoring
- Model usage tracking
- Error reporting

### **4. Improved Actions**
- Schedule follow-ups
- Add reminders
- Better goal management
- Enhanced people tracking

## Benefits

### **Performance**
