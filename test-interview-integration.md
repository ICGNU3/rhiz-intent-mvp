# üéØ Interview Agent Integration - COMPLETE!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Voice Stream Route Updated** (`/api/voice/stream/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Replaced old `Agent` class with new `InterviewAgent`
- ‚úÖ Removed string-based `conversationContext` 
- ‚úÖ Added proper conversation/message persistence to database
- ‚úÖ Integrated n8n trigger calls for enrichment
- ‚úÖ Added interview completion detection and summary generation

### 2. **Interview Flow Now Works Like This**:

```typescript
// When audio arrives:
1. Transcribe audio ‚Üí "I met Sarah from TechCorp"
2. InterviewAgent processes ‚Üí Extracts entities, generates response
3. Agent responds ‚Üí "Sarah from TechCorp, interesting! What's her role there?"
4. Speech synthesis ‚Üí Audio sent back to user
5. n8n enrichment ‚Üí Triggered in background for "Sarah" 
6. Database saved ‚Üí Conversation and entities persisted
```

### 3. **Key Integration Points**:

**Starting a conversation:**
```typescript
case 'start_conversation':
  - Reset interview agent
  - Send greeting: "Hi! I'm here to help..."
  - Initialize conversation in DB
```

**Processing speech:**
```typescript
case 'audio_chunk':
  - Transcribe audio
  - Process with InterviewAgent
  - Get response + next question
  - Trigger n8n enrichment for new entities
  - Save to conversation history
```

**Ending interview:**
```typescript
if (interviewResponse.shouldEndInterview):
  - Generate summary
  - Trigger comprehensive n8n processing
  - Trigger relationship analysis
  - Save final summary to DB
```

## üß™ How to Test

### Option 1: Test via Voice Recording UI
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/voice-chat
3. Click record and say: "I just met Sarah Chen from TechCorp, she's the VP of Engineering"
4. Watch the console for:
   - Transcription appearing
   - Agent response with follow-up question
   - Entity extraction logs
   - n8n trigger attempts (will fail without n8n running)

### Option 2: Test via API directly
```bash
# Test the POST endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/voice/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "audio_chunk",
    "audioData": "base64_encoded_audio_here"
  }'
```

### Option 3: Test Interview Agent in isolation
```javascript
// In browser console or Node REPL
const { InterviewAgent } = require('./apps/web/lib/interview-agent');
const agent = new InterviewAgent();

const response = await agent.processUserInput("I met Sarah from TechCorp");
console.log(response);
// Output: { response: "...", nextQuestion: "...", entities: {...} }
```

## üîÑ What Happens Now

When you record voice:
1. **Real-time transcription** shows what you said
2. **Interview agent** asks intelligent follow-up questions
3. **Entities extracted** (people, companies, goals)
4. **n8n triggered** for enrichment (if configured)
5. **Database updated** with conversation history
6. **Summary generated** when interview ends

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Needs n8n Setup

The n8n workflows need to be created in your n8n instance:
1. Start n8n: `docker-compose up n8n`
2. Access n8n: http://localhost:5678
3. Create the 8 workflows described in `/docs/N8N_INTERVIEW_WORKFLOWS.md`
4. Add API credentials (Clearbit, LinkedIn, etc.)
5. Test webhook endpoints

## üéâ Ready to Use!

The interview agent is now fully integrated into the voice stream. Try it out:
- Record a conversation about a meeting
- Watch it extract people and goals
- See intelligent follow-up questions
- Get a summary at the end

The system is ready for intelligent relationship capture!
